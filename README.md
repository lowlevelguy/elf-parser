# ELF Parser

I'm not yet sure where exactly I want to go with this, but I'm currently just writing this to get a better grasp on the structure of an ELF executable.

## Unsupported stuff
I'm only planning on supporting `amd64`, `i386`, `aarch64`, `arm` and `riscv` architectures; though I've yet to get to implementing the code for the 64-bit ones.

## List of things to do for now:
[x] ELF header parsing\
[] Program header parsing\
[] Section header parsing

## Possible future ideas:
- Disassembler
