# ELF Parser

I'm not yet sure where exactly I want to go with this, but I'm currently just writing this to get a better grasp on the structure of an ELF executable.

## List of things to do for now:
\[-] ELF header parsing\
\[] Program header parsing\
\[] Section header parsing


\[x]: Done\
\[-]: In progress\
\[]: Haven't started\

## Possible future ideas:
- Disassembler
